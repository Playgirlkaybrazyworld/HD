## Disclaimers

The [4chan](https://4chan.org/) image board tolerates more free speech than most people are
comfortable with. Some 4chan users are bigots, bullies, criminals, jerks, and/or trolls.
The author(s) of this application do not condone any of these users or their posts or acts.

The HD application is not associated with the [4chan](https://4chan.org/) image board web site.
